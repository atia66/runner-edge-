Runner Edge is a custom deep learning framework, written in C++ and wrapped for Python, aimed at providing the core functionalities found in libraries like PyTorch but with a lightweight and efficient design. Built from the ground up, Runner Edge focuses on fundamental neural network operations, including convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and backpropagation, with optimized performance for projects where a full-scale deep learning library may be overkill.

Features:

Core deep learning components for model building and training
C++ backend optimized for speed, with Python interface
Designed for flexibility and ease of integration into larger systems
This project is ideal for anyone interested in understanding or implementing foundational neural network operations or looking for a streamlined deep learning library for research and small to medium-scale projects.
