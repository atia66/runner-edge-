# Runner Edge

Runner Edge is a custom deep learning framework built in C++ with a Python interface. It captures essential features of popular libraries like PyTorch, focusing on high performance and acceptable time complexity.

## Key Features

### Core Neural Network Layers
Includes convolutional layers, fully connected layers, and backpropagation support.

### Optimized C++ Backend
Designed for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time or resource-constrained applications.

### Python Interface
Uses Cython to interface the C++ backend with Python.

### Use it 
 you need to run `setup.py` file in triminal  `python setup.py build_ext --inplace`
 and import framework into python files
